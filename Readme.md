Limitations of the project:
> My knowlege about javascript, css, html and highcharts
> I don't know how highcharts work so it was very hard to find things that were required to do.
> Like I didn't even know what to search to get the solution
> Project required for us to know a lot details about the tools and the documentation was very hard to udnerstand
